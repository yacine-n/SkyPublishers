# SkyPublishers

Sky Publishers takes publishing orders from clients to publish various types of materials such as magazines, books, and newspapers.
The proposed new system will do away with the practice of storing information in files and instead store information in a centralized database. This will help in easy data retrieval and maintenance. Securing data will also become easier by implementing authentication and authorization techniques.
The new system can be designed in a 3-tier architecture and developed using the
following components:
􀂄􀀃Presentation tier: Consisting of Servlets and JSPs. JSP pages can be used for
accepting the data and displaying the final results to the users. Servlets can be
used to manage application flow depending upon user requests.
􀂄􀀃Business logic layer: Consisting of session beans and entity beans. The system
will need to manage transactions while a user places a publishing order.
Security features will also need to be implemented to secure online payments.
Using enterprise beans will help the application to take advantage of the
transaction and security features provided by the EJB Container in the J2EE
Application Server.
􀂄􀀃Data tier: Consisting of SQL Server 2000 database to store the relevant data.
